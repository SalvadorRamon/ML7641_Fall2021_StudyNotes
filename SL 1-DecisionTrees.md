# Decision Tree

## Supervised learning include Classification and Regression
- Difference between Classification and Regression
- Is it Classificatino or Regression problem?
    - Depends on the output. 
    - The output is discrete: Regression
    - The output is not discrete: Classification

## Classification learning
- Keywords
    - Instances: input
    - Concept: function (maps input to output)
    - Target concept: actual answer (the things we are trying to find)
    - Hypothesis (class): all the functions that could think about
    - Sample: training set
    - Candidate: a concept that you think might be the target concept
    - Testing: testing set
- Decision tree expression:
    - And: ![andexp]()
    - Or: ![Orexp]()
    - XOr (either one): ![xorexp]()
    - Try to have OR problem instead of XOR (complext)
        - ![complexity]()
