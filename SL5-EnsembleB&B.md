# Ensemble Learning: Boosting
- Emsemble learning characteristic:
    - take some simple rules
    - combine simple rule to complex rule
    - Spam email example:

    - Why look at subset of data instead of all data?
        - If we look at all data, it is hard to generate **simple rule**.
        - this is related to overfitting as well.
- Implementation:
    - Simple way:
        - subset of data: select randomly (uniformly random)
        - combine: average each subset
        -  ![]()
